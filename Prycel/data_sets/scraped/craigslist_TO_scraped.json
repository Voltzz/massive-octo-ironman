With the Powermat system, you choose a mat and then choose the receivers to match the devices you want to charge. Each mat includes a Universal Powercube receiver that allows you to charge hundreds of devices. You can also purchase receivers custom designed to fit on your devices, so you never need to remove them to use your device.", "\nThe Powermat Wireless Charging System", "\nWireless Charging", "\nConnect your devices to Powermat Receivers, and simply drop them on the Powermat to charge wirelessly, as fast or faster than the stock power adaptor.

It's made with DuPont Kevlar fiber, which gives an other-worldly sturdiness to the outer shell. This smartphone has a splash-guard coating too, a high-tech, invisible nanocoating that shields against the unexpected splash not only on the outside, but on the electrical circuit board inside the housing as well. Boasting a 4.3-inch Colour Boost display, which offers a wider range of colour, more vibrant than the iPhone 4S. With 35 percent more pixels, MOTOROLA RAZR V also features a higher resolution than its competition,so you can see more detail. The screen is not only scratch resistant, but also features a protective splash-guard shield ", "\nThe webcam is perfect for video chats, while the hi-speed 8 MP camera features a touchscreen focus. It takes great shots, even in low light. And you can take stills while recording video in 1080p HD. Image stabilization technology makes it smooth and very easy to use.", "\nAnd now Motorola has gone one step further and built something called Smart Actions,the free pre-loaded smart actions app intelligently automates everyday tasks and suggests ways to personalize your phone. There's a Battery Extender rule that recognizes when it's time to preserve battery power. Pick it, and your MOTOROLA RAZR V dims its display, turns off the GPS and disables background data -- helping save hours of battery life and add time between charges. It's always looking for ways to improve your phone's operating performance, so with the correct settings your phone can last very very long.", "\nMOTOROLA RAZR V runs on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), a new unified phone-and-tablet user interface that builds on the things people love most about Android: easy multitasking, rich notifications, customizable home screens and resizable widgets. And now you're able to take screen shots. Just grab and send. It's a powerful new way to share...and lastly this amazing superphone is built with security that is above and beyond the basic, with government-grade encryption of email, contacts and your calendar, plus the ability to wipe the phone remotely,so you always have a safe peace of mind knowing that all your imporatnt stuff is protected.", "\nWith its dual-core 1.2 GHz processor and a battery that lasts longer between charges, MOTOROLA RAZR V allows you to surf, play, talk and watch more.
